I am in pain. Today, we encountered a man who was possibly homeless, mentally ill, or inebriated or possibly all of the above. He chased after us even though we told him multiple times to leave us alone. Hopefully, he has been dealt with by security. Today has been a fantastic today. 

I realize I haven't posted in a while but hey look an image: ![AE GIF](https://i.imgur.com/ktXBFXf.gif)

 I am hoping to learn more about anime.js (Documentation here: https://animejs.com/). And no it is not japanese cartoons, it is animation in javascript. 

I will have much more to write about tomorrow when I venture out into the Shenandoah Valley but currently I am in agony.
